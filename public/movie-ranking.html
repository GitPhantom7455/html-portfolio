<h1>The Best Movies According to Nirmal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. This Anime taught me any life lessons like - <br>
    It's Impossible To Empathize With Someone Without Making The Effort <br>
    To Take A Walk In Their Shoes.</p>
<h3> 3 Idiots</h3>
<p> Chase Excellence and Success will Follow.</p>
<h3> Marvel </h3>
<p> The first Marvel movie I like is Spider-Man. <br>
    With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
